Sample Application
===
 

The sample application is built on top of the [application template](https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-app-template) and [oasp4js extensions](https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js) showing their usage scenarios.







Getting Started
---
To get started you simply need to create specific folder structure, clone repositories and set up tomcat server







Install prerequisites
---



You need a Git client to clone the repository and the Node.js platform (including its package manager - npm) which allows Grunt and Bower to install the dependencies and build the application. Here you can learn how to install the prerequisites.

Additional install tomcat on your machine. In this example I assume that tomcat installation location is 



```
 '<tomcat_dir>'
```




Prepare folder structure
---



Create directories :





```
    '<oasp_dir>'
    '<oasp_dir>\java'
    '<oasp_dir>\js'
```

Structure should be like on print screen bellow:

Prepare server
-----

Open cmd and go to \java folder

```  
    cd <oasp_dir>\java 
```



Clone the server application repository using Git. In cmd type:

```  
    git clone https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j.git

    git clone https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j-sample.git 

```

Now install oasp4j  java component on tomcat. 

type

```  
    cd <oasp_dir>\java\oasp4j 

    mvn clean install 
```


Now install oasp4j-sample java component on tomcat.

In cmd type

```
    cd <oasp_dir>\java\oasp4j-sample 

    mvn clean install

```


File 'oasp4j-example-application.war'  should appear in following location

``` 
<oasp_dir>\java\oasp4j-sample\oasp4j-example-application\target 
```


Copy 'oasp4j-example-application.war'  file to 

```
<tomcat_dir>\webapps
```





Set up tomacat users 

Edit '<tomcat_dir>\conf\tomcat-users.xml'. Add roles and user passwords  like bellow:



```
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="Chief"/>
  <role rolename="Waiter"/>
  <role rolename="Cook"/>
  <role rolename="Barkeeper"/>
  <user password="chief" roles="Chief" username="chief"/>
  <user password="waiter" roles="Waiter" username="waiter"/>
  <user password="barkeeper" roles="Barkeeper"   username="barkeeper"/>
  <user password="cook" roles="Cook" username="cook"/>
</tomcat-users>
```






Set up tomcat ports

	

Edit file '<tomcat_dir>\conf\server.xml'. 

Set up port 8081. This is port number that is used by our application.

```
<Connector connectionTimeout="20000" port="8081" protocol="HTTP/1.1" redirectPort="8443"/>
```










Prepare client
-----



Now go to \js. In cmd type: 	

  



``` 

    cd <oasp_dir>\js 

```





To clone project in cmd type: 

	

```

    git clone https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-sample.git 

```





Summary
-----



Now all project structure should look like that.

Start application
=============



Start tomcat by  

```
<tomcat_dir>\bin\startup.bat 
```



Please note that all command below must be executed in project ' oasp4js-sample'  root directory.





Start application. (Developing)
-----



Start the application using Grunt:



``` 

    grunt serve

```



The above Grunt's task opens the application in your default browser (http://localhost:9000/oasp4j-example-application/)  and watches for any HTML/JavaScript/CSS changes. Once you do one, the page is reloaded automatically!



Start application. (Building)
-----



Build the application using Grunt:



``` 

    grunt serve:dist

```



The above Grunt's task creates the myapp/dist directory and put there HTML documents, CSS files (compiled from Less files) and JavaScript files (merged, minimized and obfuscated).
